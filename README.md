# FRAP
Analysis of FRAP movie generated by ND Stimulation (Nikon) in MATLAB
1. User creates input.txt file and timestamps.xlsx file corresponds to the movie frame
2. User selects/defines three regions of interest: nucleus, bleached ROI/doughnut and background when prompted
3. frapROI2csv.m reads nd2 file with nd2read and nd2finfo (modified from Joe Yeh, 2019) to create 3D matrix of pixel values for each movie, stabilise the bleached ROI with motioncorrect.m and tabulate the average pixel value for each ROI over the acquisition time in output.csv file
