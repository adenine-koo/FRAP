For selecting the optimal motioncorrect buffer size:
All movies were run through a buffer of 5 first with the savemovie option ON (savemovie == 1), the output avi files were inspected manually.
For movies with out-of-frame doughnut, the movie was reanalysed with a larger buffer (10, 15, 20 etc.)

Note: The buffer does not need to be in an increment of 5, just user preference.
Also note that larger buffer size increases the run time, typically 20 is enough to correct the frameshift good enough.

For movies not listed, a default buffer of 5 was used.
